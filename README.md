# Unreal Targets
 My first Unreal 5 game, made as a fun, test project.
 
 Goal of the project was to test and challenge my programming as well as map designing skills. Also, the project features Nanite and Lumen, Unreal Engine 5 new fetures.
 
 Goal of the game is to find and shoot all hidden targets.

The game is not optimized and is work in progress.
